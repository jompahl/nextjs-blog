answer: 'The hawk did not do it since the owl and the sparrow both cant tell the truth. Left is the owl, the sparrow and the eagle. The hawks says that the sparrow is lying, which is correct and the only possible scenario where there is only one telling the truth. This means that the eagle is lying and is also guilty for the murder.'
